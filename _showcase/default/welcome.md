    <h2>More about me!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        <code>Beyond Work</code>, I’m passionate about sports and physical activities. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I was a member of the track and field team as well as the basketball team during both high school and university. Currently, I’m learning skiing and tennis, which have become exciting new challenges for me. I also enjoy video games, with favorites including League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics. In addition, I have a deep love for travel and have explored over 30 cities across various countries, immersing myself in diverse cultures and experiences along the way.
